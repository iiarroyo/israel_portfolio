## [Project 1: WAV Player](https://github.com/israel-iap/WAV_player)

Low-cost microcontroller system for music reproduction
Designed with displaying song information, pausing, rewinding and skipping features.
Implemented in C for the Atmega2560 chip.

This system has the following functions:

- Play songs in WAV format from an SD card, either mono or stereo.
- Capable of playing 6 KHz, 22.050KHz o 24 KHz of sampling rate
- Print song information in LCD display
- Play 6 different songs
- Pause/play, skip and rewind buttons

## [Project 4: Smart Home Access](https://github.com/israel-iap/IoTProject)

Face recognition-based home security system with backend API and webapp
Collaborated in developing backend Python script for further deployment.
Implemented communication between webcam and a Firebase server for face detection in C++

## [Project 5: Isle Delfino Map](https://github.com/israel-iap/IsleDelfino_DataStructures/tree/master/ActIntegral4)

This program presents a board with some locations, some of them can be given by the user. The way of storing locations is ina Red-BLack tree, so it is sorted. And you can keep track of the locations you have visited in a Splay Tree. The referece map is the following:
